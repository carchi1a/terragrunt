// Package strict provides utilities used by Terragrunt to support a "strict" mode.
// By default strict mode is disabled, but when Enabled, any breaking changes
// to Terragrunt behavior that is not backwards compatible will result in an error.
//
// Note that any behavior outlined here should be documented in /docs/_docs/04_reference/strict-mode.md
//
// That is how users will know what to expect when they enable strict mode, and how to customize it.
