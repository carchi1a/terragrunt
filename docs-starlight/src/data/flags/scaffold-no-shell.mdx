Shell functions in scaffold templates are **enabled by default**. The `--no-shell` flag allows you to disable them for security reasons when needed.

## Configuration Precedence

The setting can be configured in multiple ways with the following precedence order:

1. CLI flag (`--no-shell`)
2. Catalog configuration (`no_shell = true`)

## Example

```bash
terragrunt scaffold github.com/org/repo//modules/mysql --no-shell
```

This disables shell functions in the scaffold templates, preventing execution of shell commands like `{{shell "date"}}`.
