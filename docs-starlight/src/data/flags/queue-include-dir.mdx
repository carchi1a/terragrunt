description: Unix-style glob of directories to include in the queue of Units to run.
type: list(string)
env:
  - TG_QUEUE_INCLUDE_DIR
---

Specifies directories to include when running commands with [`--all`](/docs/reference/cli/commands/run#all).

This flag can be specified multiple times to include multiple directories. When using the `TG_QUEUE_INCLUDE_DIR` environment variable, specify the directories as a comma-separated list.

To learn more about how to use this flag, see the [Stacks](/docs/features/stacks) feature documentation.

<Aside type="note">
Glob patterns must use unix forward slashes `/` to separate directories.

Glob behavior for `**` and `**/*` will change in a future version of Terragrunt.

See the [double-star strict control](docs/reference/strict-controls/#double-star) for full details.
