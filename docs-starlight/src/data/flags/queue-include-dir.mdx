description: Unix-style glob of directories to include in the queue of Units to run.
type: list(string)
env:
  - TG_QUEUE_INCLUDE_DIR
---

Specifies directories to include when running commands with [`--all`](/docs/reference/cli/commands/run#all).

This flag can be specified multiple times to include multiple directories. When using the `TG_QUEUE_INCLUDE_DIR` environment variable, specify the directories as a comma-separated list.

To learn more about how to use this flag, see the [Stacks](/docs/features/stacks) feature documentation.

<Aside type="note">
Glob patterns must use unix forward slashes `/` to separate directories.

The `*` wildcard indicates any character except `/` e.g. `unit-*` matches
directories such as `unit-a`, `unit-b`.

The `**` double wildcard indicates any character including `/`, this allows
matching multiple directory depths e.g. `units/**/unit-*` matches `units/a/unit-a`
as well as `units/b/c/unit-d`
