Hooks in scaffold templates are **enabled by default**. The `--no-hooks` flag allows you to disable them for security reasons when needed.

## Configuration Precedence

The setting can be configured in multiple ways with the following precedence order:

1. CLI flag (`--no-hooks`)
2. Catalog configuration (`enable_hooks = false`)

## Example

```bash
terragrunt scaffold github.com/org/repo//modules/mysql --no-hooks
```

This disables hooks in the scaffold templates, preventing execution of `before` and `after` hooks defined in `boilerplate.yml`.
