The Terragrunt CLI is designed to make it as easy as possible to manage infrastructure at any scale.

To support that design, there are certain patterns that are used throughout the CLI. This document will help you understand those patterns so you can use the CLI more effectively.

## Usage

Most of the time, if you are trying to use Terragrunt to run a command that you would normally run with OpenTofu/Terraform, you can just replace `tofu`/ `terraform` with `terragrunt`.

Terragrunt will pass the command to `tofu`/ `terraform` with the same arguments.

```bash
terragrunt plan
```

Terragrunt doesn't always _just_ pass the command. It frequently does some additional processing to make it easier to manage infrastructure at scale. For example, in the previous `plan` command, you wouldn't have to explicitly run `init` like you would with `tofu`/ `terraform`. Terragrunt takes advantage of a feature called [Auto-init](/docs/features/auto-init) to automatically run `init` when necessary.

Using Terragrunt in this way is taking advantage of the **OpenTofu Shortcuts** that Terragrunt provides.

<LinkCard title={openTofuShortcutsEntry.data.title} href={`/${openTofuShortcutsEntry.id}`} description={openTofuShortcutsEntry.data.description} />

Terragrunt also has some other commands that are unique to Terragrunt.

## Main Commands

These are the main commands you will use with Terragrunt:

{
    mainCommands.map((doc) => (
        <LinkCard title={doc.data.title} href={`/${doc.id}`} description={doc.data.description} />
    ))
}

## Stack Commands

These are the commands that are used when working with a `terragrunt.stack.hcl` file:

{
    stackCommands.map((doc) => (
        <LinkCard title={"stack " + doc.data.title} href={`/${doc.id}`} description={doc.data.description} />
    ))
}

## Catalog Commands

These are the commands that are used when working with a Terragrunt catalog:

{
    catalogCommands.map((doc) => (
        <LinkCard title={doc.data.title} href={`/${doc.id}`} description={doc.data.description} />
    ))
}

## Configuration Commands

These are the commands that are used to interact directly with Terragrunt configuration:

{
    configurationCommands.map((doc) => (
        <LinkCard title={doc.data.title} href={`/${doc.id}`} description={doc.data.description} />
    ))
}
