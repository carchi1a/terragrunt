<Command name={frontmatter.title}>

## Usage

```bash
terragrunt run plan
```

Note that the `run` command is a more explicit way to run OpenTofu/Terraform commands, and it provides some flexible options that are not available with [OpenTofu shortcuts](/docs/reference/cli/commands/opentofu-shortcuts).

The `run` command also supports the following flags that can be used to drive runs in multiple units:

- [`--all`](#all): Run the provided OpenTofu/Terraform command against all units in the current stack.
- [`--graph`](#graph): Run the provided OpenTofu/Terraform command against the graph of dependencies for the unit in the current working directory.

## Separating Arguments

You may, at times, need to explicitly separate the arguments used for Terragrunt from those used for OpenTofu/Terraform. In those circumstances, you can use the argument `--` to separate the Terragrunt flags from the OpenTofu/Terraform flags.

```bash
terragrunt run -- plan -no-color
```

</Command>
